1. Refactor the state data to a JSON file. Add a ```services.js``` file to your project, and read
the data from there. Tie this to the d3 function in the controller.

chart. For example, display the differences in price between Apple, Disney, Google, and Facebook.
3. Chose a data set to visualize as a bar chart and do it!
