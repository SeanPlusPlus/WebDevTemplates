# JS Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this
directory._

1. Display ```hello world``` in all caps.
2. Display the letters A through Z without typing them out. (Hint: this snippet will assign the
letter ```A``` to the variable ```chr```: ```var chr = String.fromCharCode(65);```).
3. Report the frequency of each character in ```hello world```. Sort the characters from most to least
common. A tie break should go to the character lower in the alphabet. Wrap your output in a ```ul```
tag with an ```li``` for each row. Your output should look something like this:
```
l: 3
o: 2
d: 1
e: 1
h: 1
r: 1
w: 1
```
