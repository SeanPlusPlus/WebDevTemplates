# Angular JS Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are
ready, commit the files push to your public GitHub repo. For example, your solution to the 
first challenge should be in a directory named ```challenge1/``` inside of this current directory._

1. Add a footer and display the current date and time.
2. Using the ```ng-click``` directive, add a function that casts a thing in the ```awesome_things``` array
to uppercase when you click on the thing.
3. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print ```Fizz```
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ```Buzz```. For numbers which are multiples of
both three and five print ```FizzBuzz```.
4. Move the controller and the directive to separate files.
