# Angular JS Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are
ready, commit the files and push them to your public GitHub repo. For example, your solution to the 
first challenge should be in a directory named ```challenge1/``` inside of this current directory._

1. Add a footer and display the current date and time.
2. Using the ```ng-click``` directive, add a function that casts a thing in the ```awesome_things``` array
to uppercase when you click on the thing.
3. Display the awesome things alphabetically. Add a button to the page; when you click on this button it reverses the order of the awesome things. You can click the button as many times as you like, and it keeps reversing the order from its current state.
4. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print ```Fizz```
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ```Buzz```. For numbers which are multiples of
both three and five print ```FizzBuzz```. Display the results in a directive named ```<fizzbuzz>```.
