# Angular JS Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this
directory._

1. Add a footer and display the current date and time.
2. Using the ```ng-click``` directive, add a function that casts a thing in the ```awesome_things``` array
to uppercase when you click on the thing.
3. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print ```Fizz```
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ```Buzz```. For numbers which are multiples of
both three and five print ```FizzBuzz```.
4. Move the controller and the directive to separate files.
