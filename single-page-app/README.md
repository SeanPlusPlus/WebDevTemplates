# Single Page Applications

_this is where it gets rad_

Note: you will need to run your web server from the root the project.

For example, if you want to run the ```basic``` project, open a terminal and do this:

```
$ cd WedDevTemplates/single-page-apps/basic
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And then open your browser to http://localhost:8000 and view the project.
