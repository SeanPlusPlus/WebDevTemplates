# Form Alert Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are
ready, commit the files and push them to your public GitHub repo. For example, your solution to the 
first challenge should be in a directory named ```challenge1/``` inside of this current directory._

1. Change the radio label from ```Stoke Level``` to ```Alert Type```. The three options should be ```Success```,
```Warning```, and ```Error```. After the user selects the ```Alert Type```, and presses ```Submit```, the type of
Sweet Alert should change according to the one selected.
2. Only display one form input on the page. This input should only allow integers. On submit, 
the alert should display the number that was entered in English. For example, if the user enters
the number ```1215``` the alert should display ```one thousand two hundred and fifteen```.
