# Form Alert Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this

1. Change the radio label from "Stoke Level" to "Alert Type". The three options should be "Success",
"Warning", and "Error". After the user selects the "Alert Type", and presses "Submit", the type of
Sweet Alert should change according to the one selected.
2. Display the user name in the alert.
3. Only display one form input on the page. This input should only allow integers. On submit, 
the alert should display the number that was entered in English. For example, if the user enters
the number ```1215``` the alert should display ```one thousand two hundred and fifteen```.
