# Sanitize Form Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are
ready, commit the files and push them to your public GitHub repo. For example, your solution to the 
first challenge should be in a directory named ```challenge1/``` inside of this current directory._

1. Display a single input on the page. On submit, determine if the text entered by the user is a
palindrome. Log the answer to the dev console.
2. Display a single input on the page. The input should only accept integer values. 
On submit, draw a triangle on the page using asteriks ```*``` where the length and
width of the triangle is determined by the user input. As an example, if the user entered ```7```, 
your output should look somthing like this:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
```
