# Sanitize Form Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this
directory._

1. Add a form element for email address and verify this is correct.
2. Add a form element for phone number and verify that it is a normal US number.
3. Display a single input on the page. On submit, determine if the text entered by the user is a
palindrome. Log the answer to the dev console.
