# Basic Form Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this
directory._

1. Display a single input on the page. On submit count all of the characters that the user
entereed. Display your answer in the dev console.
2. Display a single input on the page. On submit report the character frequency for all the characters the user
entered. Sort the characters from most to least common. A tie break should go to the
character lower in the alphabet. Ignore white space and all punctuation. Cast all characters to
lower case. Only display ASCII characters. Wrap your output in a ```<ul>``` tag with an ```<li>``` for each row. 
As an example, if the user entered ```Sean Plus Plus```, your output should 
look something like this:
```
s: 3
l: 2
p: 2
u: 2
a: 1
e: 1
n: 1
```
