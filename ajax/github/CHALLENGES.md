# GitHub AJAX Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are

```api``` directory) to save a local cache of the user data (you will also need to pass
```"local": true``` as a parameter to the ```helloService.async``` request.
