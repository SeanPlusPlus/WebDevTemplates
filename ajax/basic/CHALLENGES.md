# AJAX Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, create a directory named challenge# (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number), add your files to this directory, and then when you are
ready, commit the files and push them to your public GitHub repo. For example, your solution to the 
first challenge should be in a directory named ```challenge1/``` inside of this current directory._


1. Display each of the ```awesome_things``` as a list element ```<li>``` in an ordered list ```<ol>``` in the order of their rank.
2. When clicking on an element in the awesome things list, display the imageurl of the awesome thing on
the right hand side of the page. Your solution should look something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/T4sZMEr.png).
