# AJAX Challenges

_For each challenge listed below, save your answer to a file named challenge#.html (replacing the
"#" symbol with the challenge number) and then push this file to your GitHub repo. For example, your
solution to the first challenge should be saved to a file named ```challenge1.html``` in this
directory._

1. Display each of the "awesome_things" as a list element "li" in an ordered list "ol" in the order of their rank.
2. When clicking on an element in the awesome things list, display the imageurl of the awesome thing on
the right hand side of the page. Your solution should look something [like this](http://i.imgur.com/T4sZMEr.png).
